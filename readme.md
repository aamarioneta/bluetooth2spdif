# bluetooth2spdif

A very simple Bluetooth to S/PDIF adapter.

Connect the IR led to the TX and GND of the ESP32 and voila, you have a bluetooth to S/PDIF adapter which you can connect to any AV receiver.

You can also use a simple red led but you should use a Optical Toslink connector to be able to connect it with the AV receiver with a optical toslink cable.
